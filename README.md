# Using Bluetooth Web API with JavaScript

The Bluetooth Web API, available in modern web browsers, empowers developers to integrate Bluetooth functionality seamlessly into web applications. With the power of JavaScript, developers can harness the capabilities of Bluetooth-enabled devices directly from the browser, opening up a realm of possibilities for interactive and connected web experiences.

### **Features üöÄ**

1. **Device Discovery**: Explore nearby Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices and connect to them effortlessly with the `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice()` method.
2. **Service Interaction**: Interact with Bluetooth GATT services, including reading and writing characteristics, receiving notifications, and managing device connections.
3. **Security Integration**: Ensure secure communication by leveraging the security features of the Bluetooth Web API, such as HTTPS-only access and user gesture requirements for device discovery.

### **Getting Started**

To start using the Bluetooth Web API, follow these simple steps:

1. **Include Bluetooth Permission**: Ensure your web application requests Bluetooth permissions from the user. This is typically done through a user gesture such as a click or touch event.
2. **Device Discovery**: Utilize the `navigator.bluetooth.requestDevice()` method to discover nearby Bluetooth devices. Specify optional services or filter devices based on specific criteria.
3. **Service Interaction**: Connect to the selected device and interact with its services and characteristics. Read and write characteristic values, receive notifications, and manage connections as needed.

### **Code Base üõ†Ô∏è**

Below are the key files needed for implementing the Bluetooth Web API:

1. **index.html**: The HTML file that serves as the entry point for your web application. Include necessary elements such as buttons and containers for displaying device information.
2. **script.js**: The JavaScript file responsible for handling user interactions, device discovery, and service interaction.
3. **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the elements in your web application.

#### Note : It's important to note that the Bluetooth Web API has limited connectivity, and not all Bluetooth devices can be connected. Currently, it supports connecting to devices that implement the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard.
